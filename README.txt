The Retail Analysis built-in sample contains a dashboard, report, and dataset that analyzes retail sales data of items sold.

In this we are going to analyse the superstore dataset that's contains lot's of informations such as the customer ID his name the city of the custome and so on. 

Superstore sales and performance: It is the first step to gaining an understanding of the superstore’s performance over time.
 We need data on sales for different regions every quarter. It is also essential to determine which regions are more profitable than others.

Performance of different states: Once we have region-wise information on profits and losses,
 it is possible to create a scatterplot of “sales vs. profit” at state and regional levels, with sales and profit being X and Y, respectively. 
To understand different situations, these states can be mapped. A business might decide to invest more in a state with lower sales but higher profits. 
If sales are rising but profits are falling, another state could be flagged


Performance of different customer segments: It’s also essential for a business to identify which customer segment is driving sales in different areas. 
A pie chart showing customer segments and sales/ profits can be used to help businesses plan future strategies. 
For example, the B2B consumer segment may be driving the highest profit but has very few sales. There is an enormous opportunity to grow the B2B segment.

Revenue generation per category: We can obtain data about specific product categories within specific regions or customer segments and compare them (in terms of sales and profits).
 It is possible to gain valuable insights to help you plan for the future.
